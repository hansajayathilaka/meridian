# Phase 1 — Review of Phase 0

**Kind:** review · **Status:** in progress · **Reviews phase(s):** Phase 0 (Features 1–5, T01–T05)

## Goal
Sweep everything built in Phase 0 for bugs, gaps, loopholes, and on-the-fly decisions, then close the
actionable findings. The sweep is done ([review-report.md](./review-report.md), findings F1–F22); this
phase turns those findings into fix-tasks and lands them. Verdict: **blocked until F1, F2, F3, F10, F11
resolved** before Feature 10 (media) or Phase 2 (T06 federation) stacks further work.

## Chosen feature(s) / scope
Fix-tasks derived from [review-report.md](./review-report.md). Ordering follows the Verdict's priority
chain: doc/ADR truth → freeze the crypto → make the gates real → close Features 4/5 honestly →
design decisions + remaining should-fix/nit.

## Dependency check
The Phase 0 build is complete; its review report is written. Fix-tasks are unblocked now. Internal
dependencies between fix-tasks are declared per task (notably 1.2→1.1, 1.15→1.13/1.3, 1.16→1.15/1.14,
1.22→1.15, 1.24→1.22, 1.25→1.14, 1.26→1.24/1.25, 1.27→1.26). 1.23 was split before implementation into
1.24-1.27 (see [1.23](./1.23-netns-nat-matrix.md)'s Status); 1.24 and 1.25 were independent of each other
and proceeded in parallel — both are now done. 1.26 (needs both) is next.

## Exit criteria
All fix-tasks `[x]`, tree green (`just build` + `cargo clippy -D warnings` clean), docs synced. Blocking
findings F1, F2, F3, F10, F11 closed — for F10/F11 this means 1.13–1.16, 1.22, and 1.24–1.27 landed
(backend 1.15 and the netns/tcpdump matrix chain 1.24–1.27 are the tasks that may span multiple PRs; 1.23
itself was split before implementation, see its file). Then `/pick-next-phase` selects Phase 2
(T06 federation).

## Finding → fix-task map
| F | Sev | Task | F | Sev | Task |
|---|-----|------|---|-----|------|
| F1 | blocking | 1.6 | F12 | should-fix | 1.19 |
| F2 | blocking | 1.1 | F13 | should-fix | 1.18 |
| F3 | blocking | 1.2 | F14 | should-fix | 1.9 |
| F4 | should-fix | 1.8 | F15 | should-fix | 1.10 |
| F5 | should-fix | 1.5 | F16 | should-fix | 1.12 |
| F6 | should-fix | 1.5 | F17 | should-fix | 1.12 |
| F7 | should-fix | 1.7 | F18 | should-fix | 1.8 |
| F8 | should-fix | 1.11 | F19 | should-fix | 1.4 |
| F9 | should-fix | 1.3 | F20 | nit | 1.16 |
| F10 | blocking | 1.13 + 1.15 | F21 | nit | 1.20 |
| F11 | blocking | 1.14 + 1.22 + 1.24 + 1.25 + 1.26 + 1.27 | F22 | nit | 1.21 |

On-the-fly decisions: ratchet composition → 1.1 (ADR 0015); deniability vs envelope signature → 1.17
(ADR); desync auto-recovery → 1.18; active relay-rewrite adversarial test (flagged during 1.23's split,
not part of F11's closure) → 1.28. **No action** (already recorded as deferred): threat-model goal 2
key-substitution half → Feature 8.
